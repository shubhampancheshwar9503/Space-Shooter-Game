The Space Shooter game is an exciting arcade-style game where players control a spaceship and engage in battles against waves of enemy spaceships. In this tutorial, we will create a Space Shooter game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML will provide the structure for our game, CSS will handle the visual styling and layout, and JavaScript will handle the game's logic and interactivity.

Throughout this tutorial, we will cover the following steps:

Setting up the HTML structure: We will create the necessary HTML elements for the game screen, player spaceship, enemy spaceships, score display, and game controls.

Styling the game elements with CSS: We will use CSS to design and position the game screen, player spaceship, enemy spaceships, and other visual elements. This will allow us to create an engaging and visually appealing game interface.

Implementing player control: We will use JavaScript to handle player input and control the spaceship's movement. This will allow players to navigate the spaceship across the game screen and shoot projectiles at the enemy spaceships.

Generating enemy spaceships: Using JavaScript, we will generate waves of enemy spaceships that appear on the screen and move towards the player's spaceship. We will implement their movement patterns and determine their behavior, such as firing projectiles or performing evasive maneuvers.

Handling collisions and scoring: We will use JavaScript to detect collisions between projectiles, player spaceship, and enemy spaceships. When collisions occur, we will update the game's score and remove destroyed spaceships from the screen.

Power-ups and upgrades: We can introduce power-ups or upgrades to enhance the player's spaceship. JavaScript will handle their generation, behavior, and effects on gameplay.

Game over and restart functionality: We will implement game over conditions, such as when the player's spaceship is destroyed or a certain score threshold is reached. Players will have the option to restart the game after a game over.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional Space Shooter game that can be played in a web browser. Let's begin by setting up the HTML structure and styling the game elements using CSS.
